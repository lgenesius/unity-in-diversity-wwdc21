# Unity in Diversity
Hello guys! I've won WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge and this is my playground that I submitted for WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge<br>
My playground is about teach Unity in Diversity to childrens with the concept of play-based learning and the objects I chose are objects that exist in everyday life with the aim of making it easy for children to remember their moral values.<br><br>

I used UIKit and AVFoundation to build this playground. I also used UIDragInteraction and UIDropInteraction to implement drag and drop, AVSpeechSynthesizer to build the voice guide and UIBezierPath to shape the rectangle into rainbow!
